# Space Portfolio

This repo contains a space-themed portfolio built with React and Vite. The UI leans into purple, blue, and black gradients with cinematic cards, star fields, and cosmic highlights.

## Getting started

1. Install Node.js 18+.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Vite dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Vite will print the local URL (by default `http://localhost:5173`).

## Building and running with Node.js

1. Create a production build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This outputs static assets to `dist/`.
2. Serve the build with the provided Node/Express server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server serves `dist/` on `http://localhost:4173` (configurable via `PORT`).

You can also preview the production build with Vite by running `npm run preview`.
